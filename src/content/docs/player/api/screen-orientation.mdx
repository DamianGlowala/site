## Requesting

The player uses the native [Screen Orientation API][screen-orientation-api] to lock and unlock
the document's orientation. You can request screen orientation changes by using the
[remote control](#remote-control) or via [methods](#methods) on the player instance.

:::info
All [Screen Orientation API][caniuse-screen-orientation] methods are not available in all
browsers. For example, iOS Safari does not support `lock` and `unlock`.

### Remote Control

The [media remote][media-remote] provides methods for dispatching `media-orientation-lock-request`
and `media-orientation-unlock-request` events like so:

::code[./remote-control]
