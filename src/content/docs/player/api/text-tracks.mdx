## Loading

The [Loading Text Tracks][loading-tracks] guide covers how to initialize tracks and supported
formats/kinds.

[loading-tracks]: /docs/wc/player/core-concepts/loading#text-tracks

## Tracks List

The read-only `textTracks` property on the player returns a `TextTrackList` object that
contains `TextTrack` objects. Keep in mind the mentioned objects are custom implementations and
not the browser's native classes.

The returned list is live; that is, as tracks are added to and removed from the player, the
list's contents change dynamically. Once you have a reference to the list, you can monitor it
for changes to detect when new tracks are added or existing ones are removed by
[listening to list events](#list-events).

::code[./tracks-list]

### List Events

The `TextTrackList` object is an [`EventTarget`][event-target] which dispatches the following events:

- `add`: Fired when a text track has been added to the list.
- `remove`: Fired when a text track has been removed from the list.
- `mode-change`: Fired when the mode of any text track has changed.

::code[./list-events]

## Managing Tracks

### Add Tracks

Text tracks can be dynamically added and removed like so:

::code[./add-track]

You can also create tracks and add them programtically like so:

::code[./add-track-manual]

### Remove Tracks

Text tracks can be removed programtically like so:

::code[./remove-track]

All text tracks can be removed by calling `clear()`:

::code[./clear-tracks]

### Track Mode

The `mode` property of a text track accepts the following values:

- `showing`: Track will load, receive cue updates, and is visible on-screen.
- `hidden`: Track will load, receive cue updates, but is not visible on-screen.
- `disabled`: Track will not load and it will not receive cue updates.

::code[./mode]

Only one track per kind can have a mode of `showing`. Other tracks of the same kind that are
specifically showing will have their mode set to `disabled` on change.

### Track Events

The `TextTrack` object is an [`EventTarget`][event-target] which dispatches the following events:

- `load-start`: Fired when the track begins loading.
- `load`: Fired when the track has finished loading and parsing.
- `error`: Fired when there is a critical error loading or parsing the track.
- `add-cue`: Fired when a new cue has been added.
- `remove-cue`: Fired when a cue has been removed.
- `cue-change`: Fired when the active cues has changed.
- `mode-change`: Fired when the mode has been changed.

::code[./track-events]

## Media State

The following text track related properties are available on the media store:

- `textTracks`: An array containing the current list of TextTrack objects.
- `textTrack`: The current captions/subtitles TextTrack object or null if none is showing.

::code[./state]

:::info
If you're using React check out the [`useCaptionOptions`][use-caption-options] hook for building menus.

## Remote Control

The `changeTextTrack` method on the [media remote][media-remote] can be used to dispatch
`media-text-track-change-request` request events to update the current audio track like so:

::code[./remote]

## Media Events

The following text track related events are available on the player:

::code[./media-events]
