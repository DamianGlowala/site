description: An overview on how to configure global keyboard shortcuts.

## Key Target

The `keyTarget` property can be used to specify the target on which to listen to key events. The
available targets include:

- `document`: key down events will be listened to on the entire document. In the case that multiple
  players are on the page, only the player that was recently interacted with will receive input.
- `player`: key down events will be listened to on the player itself when it or one of its
  children were recently interacted with.

::code[./key-target]

## Configuring Shortcuts

The `keyShortcuts` property extends global player key shortcuts. The shortcuts can be
specified as a space-separated list of combinations (e.g., `p Control+Space`), array of keys,
or a callback. This property is loosely modelled after the [`aria-keyshortcuts`][aria-keys]
attribute, see the link for more information and tips for picking good shortcuts.

::code[./shortcuts]

:::info
If `aria-keyshortcuts` is specified on a component then it will take precedence over the
respective value set here.

## ARIA Key Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts can be specified on individual buttons like so:

::code[./aria-keys]

If the `aria-keyshortcuts` is specified on a component, it will take precedence over the
global configuration. If it is not set, the player will set the attribute on the component
based on the global config so screen readers can announce shortcuts.

ðŸ‘‰ See the [`aria-keyshortcuts`][aria-keys] docs for more information.

## Disabling Keyboard

We strongly recommend not disabling keyboard shortcuts for accessibility reasons, but if required
you can disable them like so:

::code[./disable]

This will not disable standard ARIA keyboard controls for individual components when focused.
