## Requesting

The player will use the [Picture In Picture][pip-api] (PIP) on supported browsers and
[WebKit Presentation API][presentation-api] on iOS Safari for entering and exiting PIP mode. You can
request PIP changes by using the [`PIPButton`][pip-button], [remote control](#remote-control), or
via [methods](#methods) on the player instance.
