description: Helpful methods when working with event triggers.
---

All events dispatched by the player contain a `triggers` property which is a `EventTriggers`
class instance. It stores a history of events that were responsible for triggering the event
it was stored on. For example, `media-play-request` will lead to `play` being fired, hence it's
referred to as a "trigger." Below you'll find methods that can be used to modify or inspect the
trigger event chain.

## `add`

Appends the given event to the chain. The origin of the appended event will become the
new origin.

::code[./add]

## `remove`

Removes the event from the chain and returns it (if found).

::code[./remove]

## `has`

Whether the chain contains the given event.

::code[./has]

## `hasType`

Whether an event with the given `type` exists in the chain.

::code[./has-type]

## `findType`

Whether an event with the given `type` exists in the chain. If found, the event will
be returned.

::code[./find-type]

## `walk`

Walks an event chain, and invokes the given callback for each trigger event.
If a `value` is returned by the callback, the walk will end and `[event, value]` will be returned.

::code[./walk]
