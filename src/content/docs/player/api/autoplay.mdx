### Autoplay Policy

Autoplay policy in web browsers refers to the rules and restrictions governing when and how media
content, such as audio or video, can automatically play without user interaction on websites.
Autoplay policies were introduced to improve the user experience by preventing annoying and
intrusive autoplay of media.

Key points about autoplay policy:

- **Muted Autoplay**: Most modern browsers allow muted autoplay by default. This means that videos
  or audio content can start playing automatically, but with the sound muted. Users can then choose
  to enable the sound if they wish.
- **Unmuted Autoplay**: Autoplay with sound (unmuted autoplay) is typically restricted. Browsers
  often require user interaction, like clicking or tapping, to allow media to play with sound. This
  prevents unexpected noise and distractions.
- **User Gesture**: Autoplay with sound may be allowed if it's initiated by a user gesture, such
  as clicking a play button. Once a user interacts with the page, media can autoplay with sound.
- **Exceptions:** Some websites and media elements can be granted exceptions to autoplay policies,
  often based on user behavior and preferences. For example, if a user frequently interacts with
  media on a site, the browser might remember this preference.
- **Developer Considerations:** Web developers should be aware of and adhere to autoplay policies
  when designing websites. They can use the autoplay attribute and JavaScript API with user
  interaction to control media autoplay.

:::info
See the article ["Autoplay policy in Chrome"][chrome-dev-autoplay] by Chrome for Developers for
more context. In short, the best chance you have for autoplay working on a site where a user is
visiting for the first time, or irregularly is by muting the media. Try to encourage the user to
either play or unmute the media themselves to avoid a poor experience.
