description: This hook is used to fetch and resolve thumbnail images.
---

This hook fetches, parses, and resolves thumbnail images from a [WebVTT file][thumbnails-vtt],
[JSON file][thumbnails-json], or [Object][thumbnails-object]. The hook will return the resolved
data for each image such as the start time, end time, coordinates, dimensions, and url. It's safe
to call this hook in multiple places with the same `src` argument as work is de-duped and cached.

:::info
See the [Loading Thumbnails][loading] guide for more information.

::code[./usage]

The hook will return the following data:

::code[./data]

You can retrieve the active thumbnail by passing the data to the `useActiveThumbnailHook` with
a desired time:

::code[./active]
