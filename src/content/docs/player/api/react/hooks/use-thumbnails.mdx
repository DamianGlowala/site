description: This hook is used to fetch and parse a WebVTT source containing thumbnail cues.
---

Fetches and parses a WebVTT file. The function will return the parsed thumbnail
data such as the VTTCue, coordinates, dimensions, and url. It's safe to call this hook in
multiple places with the same `src` argument as work is de-duped and cached.

::code[./usage]

The hook will return the following data:

::code[./data]

You can retrieve the active thumbnail by passing the data to the `useActiveThumbnailHook` with
a desired time:

::code[./active]
