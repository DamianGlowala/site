description: This component is used as a render target for the current provider.

The media provider component gives you complete control of where the provider will be rendered in
the DOM. For example, the `VideoProvider` or `HLSProvider` will render the HTML `<video>` element
inside of it, and the `AudioProvider` will render the `<audio>` element.

In a typical video player setup, you'll place the provider directly in the player and overlay
some UI (e.g., controls) over it like so:
