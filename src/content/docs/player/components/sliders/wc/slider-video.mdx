description: This component is used to load and display a preview video over the time slider.
---

The slider video component is used to show a preview video (low-resolution) as the user interacts
with the time slider. The preview video will be displayed when the user is hovering over or
dragging the time slider, and it will automatically be updated to be in-sync with the current
pointer position. Therefore, ensure it has the same length as the original media (i.e., same duration)
to avoid displaying incorrect previews.
