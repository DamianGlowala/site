description: This component is used to render and display captions/subtitles.
---

The captions component renders and displays captions/subtitles. It will be rendered as an
overlay when the player [view type][view-type] is `video`, and as a simple captions box when the
type is `audio`.

- See the [loading text tracks][loading-text-tracks] guide for how to load and manage
  captions/subtitles.
- Rendering is handled by the [media-captions][media-captions] library, see the repo for more information.
- See the [media-captions motivation section][motivation] for why native captions are not good enough.
- The player will dynamically switch to native captions when custom captions cannot
  be displayed (e.g., iOS Safari on iPhone).
