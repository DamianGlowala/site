## Events

The `event` property seen in the snippets above can be any valid DOM event type
(e.g., `touchstart`, `mouseleave`, etc.). An event listener is attached to the given event
type on the media provider, and when fired, it will trigger the action on the media provider.

In addition, any event can be prefixed with `dbl` (e.g., `dblpointerup`) to ensure it's fired twice
in succession (within 200ms) before the gesture action is triggered.

## Cancelling

Any gesture can be prevented from triggering by calling `event.preventDefault()` on the
will trigger event like so:

::code[./cancel]
