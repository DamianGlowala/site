description: A guide on how to setup the default audio/video layout and available customization options.
---

The Default Layout ships with support for audio and video. You can include both layouts at the
same time, only one will be matched depending on the view type.

::code[./usage]

By default, the view type is inferred from the provider and media type. You can specify the desired
type like so:

::code[./view-type]

## Size

Both the audio and video layout will adapt to small containers to ensure an optimal user experience.
You configure when the small layout is displayed by using [Player Queries][player-queries]:

::code[./sm-layout]

If you'd like to disable small layouts, set the query to `false` or `'never'`:

::code[./disable-sm-layout]

[player-queries]: /docs/player/styling/responsive-design#player-queries

## Icons

You can easily replace the icons used in the layouts to match the style of your application like
so:

::code[./icons]{copy=true}

::code[./provide-icons]

## Thumbnails

You can provide thumbnails which will be used to display preview images when interacting with
the time slider and in the chapters menu. The `thumbnails` property must be an absolute or
relative URL to a WebVTT file resource ([example][thumbnails-example]).

- The image URLs specified in the WebVTT file can be absolute
  `https://foo.com/media/thumbnail-1.jpg` or relative `/media/thumbnail-1.jpg`.
- The width and height of each thumbnail image should be kept the same. If sizes differ, the
  aspect ratio should remain the same to avoid jumping when previewing.
- You can specify multiple images or use a sprite (recommended) which is a large storyboard image
  as shown in the linked example.

::code[./thumbnails]

They can all be adjusted by you to customize the audio/video layout and child components as desired.

::code[./language]{copy=true}
::code[./provide-language]
