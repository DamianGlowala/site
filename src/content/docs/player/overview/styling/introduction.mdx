## Styling Elements

Vidstack Player enables styling _any child element_ of the player with CSS based on the current
media state. This is made possible by exposing media state as data attributes on the player
DOM element. You can use the presence and/or absence of these media data attributes to style
children of the player element with CSS. Here's a few simple examples:

::code[./styling-elements]{title="examples.css"}

:::info
See the [Media Player Data Attributes][player-data-attrs] reference table.
:::

The `[attr]` selector will select elements based on the presence or value of an attribute, and
the `:not()` pseudo-class represents elements that do not match a list of selectors. You can
combine attributes and selectors to express newer and more powerful conditional selectors like so:

::code[./styling-elements-complex]{title="examples.css"}

## Styling Components

Similarly to styling player elements, components also expose data attributes and CSS variables for
styling with CSS:

::code[./styled-components]
::code[./styling-components]

:::info
Refer to the Data Attributes and CSS Variables section on each [component's][components] page.

### Default Theme

To speed up development, we provide default styles out of the box for all components. The
[installation][default-theme-install] guide can get you set up. You're free to override CSS properties
and use CSS variables to further customize components as desired. The default theme is applied via
classes like so:

::code[./default-theme]{title="examples.tsx"}

You can see our [player examples][examples] to see how to apply the default theme to a variety
of components. You can also find code examples and CSS variables on each [component][components] page.

### Animations

Some components such as [Tooltips][tooltip] and [Menus][menu] are hidden (i.e., `display: none`)
when they're inactive to prevent ARIA and focus issues, and to not appear on initial mount. You can
add animations to the mentioned components using CSS. The library will wait for the animation to
end before performing any operations such as focusing the first interactive element, or forcefully
hiding the component.

## Where to start?

Now that you've familiarized yourself with how styling elements and components works, you can
start building! The best place is to start with styling any of the following:

- The [player][player] is responsive by default but you might want to set a specific width or
  aspect ratio to [prevent layout shifts][avoid-layout-shifts].
- The [provider][provider] can generally be left as-is, but it's important you understand what role
  it plays in your design.
- The [controls][controls] is a great place to start as most media components are generally
  grouped and shown/hidden together.

From there you're free to start exploring all of our components by scrolling down through the
[components][components] sidebar. They're organized into categories by their role (e.g., display,
buttons, sliders, etc.) and each contains docs on everything you need for using and customizing
them. Enjoy!
