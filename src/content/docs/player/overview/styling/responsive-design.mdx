## Sizing

Refer to the ["avoiding layout shifts"][avoiding-layout-shifts] section for how to ensure
the player doesn't jump between it's default size and intrinsic size. This is important to avoid
the page and your player layout shifting as content is loaded over the network.

## Layouts

A media player layout refers to the arrangement and presentation of various elements and
controls within a media player interface. It determines how these components are organized and
displayed to the user while playing audio or video content. A well-designed media player layout
enhances the user experience and provides easy access to essential functionalities.

The arrangement and appearance of these elements can vary, but a well-structured media player
layout ensures that users can easily control and enjoy the content, whether it's video, audio, live
streaming, or other forms of multimedia. The layout design should consider user-friendliness,
accessibility, and aesthetics to create a seamless and engaging media playback experience.

Our library comes with pre-built production-ready layouts such as the [Default Layout][default-layout] and
[Plyr Layout][plyr-layout]. However, if you prefer you can build your own custom layout. A
custom layout is preferrable when you want more control over how the player UI is arranged and
presented. You can easily build your own layout by composing and styling various
[player components][components].

## Queries

[CSS Media Queries][media-queries] are a CSS feature used to apply styles based on the
characteristics of the viewing device, such as screen size, orientation, or resolution. While
media queries are widely used for responsive web design, they have limitations when styling a
media player, particularly in scenarios where the player's size and layout need to adapt
dynamically to its container element, [view type][view-type], or [stream type][stream-type].
This is where [container queries](#container-queries) are preferable.

### Container Queries

[CSS Container Queries][container-queries] are a web development feature that allows styles to
adapt based on the dimensions and characteristics of a specific container element, rather than
the overall viewport. When designing a media player, container queries are useful for creating
responsive and adaptive layouts within the player's container. They enable precise control over
the player's appearance, ensuring it adjusts seamlessly to changes in the container's size and
context.

See the [Container Queries support table][caniuse-container-queries] as they're a relatively
new feature added to browsers.
