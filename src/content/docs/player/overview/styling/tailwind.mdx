description: A guide on installing and using the Tailwind CSS plugin.
---

If you're a fan of Tailwind CSS like we are, then you really don't want to be forced to create
a `.css` file to handle random outlier cases. It not only slows you down and breaks your flow, but
it also goes against all the [advantages of using utility classes][tw-advantages]. Our Tailwind
plugin provides you with media variants such as `media-paused:opacity-0` to help you easily style
elements based on media state.

## Installation

You can register the plugin by adding the following to `tailwind.config.js`:

::code[./installation]{title="tailwind.config.js" copy=true}

The following options are available:

::code[./options]

## Usage

The Tailwind plugin provides media variants which can be used to prefix utilities so they're
applied when a given media state is active (or not). Here are some examples:

## Not Variants

All media variants can be prefixed with `not-` to negate the selector. Classes with this prefix
will be transformed into `media-player:not([state])` selectors.

::code[./not-variants]

Few more examples:

- `not-media-paused`: Media is in the play state (not paused).
- `not-media-playing`: Media playback is not active (not playing).
- `not-media-can-play`: Media is not ready for playback (not can play).

## Data Attributes

Data attributes are applied to components throughout the library to expose internal state for
styling purposes. Tailwind supports [data attributes][tw-data-attrs] out of the box to apply styles
conditionally.

::code[./data-attrs]

:::info
All component API references include the exposed data attributes. See the [player data attributes][player-data-attrs]
as an example.

### Focus

The `data-focus` attribute is applied to all components when focused via keyboard. This attribute
can be used to apply focus styling like so:

::code[./data-focus]

### Hocus

The `data-hocus` attribute is applied to components when they're being keyboard focused or
hovered on by a pointer device. This attribute is applied to help keep class lists concise and
can be used like so:

::code[./data-hocus]
