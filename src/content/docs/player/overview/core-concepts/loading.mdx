## Avoiding Layout Shifts

By default, the browser will use the [intrinsic size][intrinsic-size] of the loaded media to
set the dimensions of the provider. As media loads over the network, the element will jump
from the default size to the intrinsic media size, triggering a layout shift which is a [poor
user experience indicator][cumulative-layout-shift] for both your users and search
engines (i.e., Google).

**Aspect Ratio**

To avoid a layout shift, we recommend setting the aspect ratio like so:

::code[./layout-shift]{ext=true}

Ideally the ratio set should match the ratio of the media content itself (i.e., intrinsic aspect ratio)
otherwise you'll end up with a letterbox template (empty black bars on the left/right of the media).

**Specify Dimensions**

If you'd like to be more specific for any reason, you can specify the `width` and `height` of the
player simply using CSS like so:

::code[./dimensions]

[cumulative-layout-shift]: https://web.dev/articles/cls

## Load Strategies

A loading strategy specifies when media should begin loading. Loading media too early
can effectively slow down your entire application, so choose wisely. The following media loading
strategies are available:

- `eager`: Load media immediately - use when media needs to be interactive as soon as possible.
- `idle`: Load media once the page has loaded and the `requestIdleCallback` is fired - use when
  media is lower priority and doesn't need to be interactive immediately.
- `visible`: Load media once it has entered the visual viewport - use when media is below the fold
  and you prefer delaying loading until it's required.
- `custom`: Load media when the `startLoading()` method is called or the `media-start-loading` event
  is dispatched - use when you need fine control of when media should begin loading.

::code[./load-strategy]

### Custom Load Strategy

A custom load strategy lets you control when media should begin loading:

::code[./load-custom-strategy]

## View Type

The view type suggests what type of media layout will be displayed. It can be either `audio` or
`video`. This is mostly to inform layouts, whether your own or the defaults, how to appropriately
display the controls and general UI. By default, the view type is inferred from the provider and
media type. You can specify the desired type like so:

::code[./view-type]

## Stream Type

The stream type refers to the mode in which content is delivered through the video player. The
player will use the type to determine how to manage state/internals such as duration updates,
seeking, and how to appropriately present UI components and layouts. The stream type can be one of
the following values:

- `vod`: Video on Demand (VOD) content is pre-recorded and can be accessed and played at any
  time. VOD streams allow viewers to control playback, pause, rewind, and fast forward.
- `live`: Live streaming delivers real-time content as it happens. Viewers join the stream and
  watch the content as it's being broadcast, with limited control over playback.
- `live:dvr`: Live DVR (Live Digital Video Recording) combines the features of both live and VOD.
  Viewers can join a live stream and simultaneously pause, rewind, and fast forward, offering more
  flexibility in watching live events.
- `ll-live`: A live streaming mode optimized for reduced latency, providing a near-real-time
  viewing experience with minimal delay between the live event and the viewer.
- `ll-live:dvr`: Similar to low-latency live, this mode enables viewers to experience live content
  with minimal delay while enjoying the benefits of DVR features (same as `live:dvr`).

If the value is not set, it will be inferred by the player which can be less accurate (e.g., at
identifying DVR support). When possible, prefer specifying it like so:

::code[./stream-type]

## Sources

The player can accept one or more media sources which can be a `string` URL of the media resource
to load, or any of the following objects: `MediaStream`, `MediaSource`, `Blob`, or `File`.

**Single Source**

::code[./single-source]

**Multiple Sources**

The list of [supported media formats](#supported-codecs) varies from one browser to the other. You should
either provide your source in a single format that all relevant browsers support, or provide multiple
sources in enough different formats that all the browsers you need to support are covered.

::code[./multiple-sources]

### Source Objects

The player accepts both audio and video source objects. This includes [MediaStream][media-stream],
[MediaSource][media-source], [Blob][blob], and [File][file].

::code[./source-object]

[media-stream]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream
[media-source]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaSource
[blob]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob
[file]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File

### Changing Source

The player supports changing the source dynamically. Simply update the `src` property when you
want to load new media. You can also set it to an empty string `""` to unload media.

::code[./source-management]

### Source Types

The player [source selection][source-selection] process relies on file extensions, object types,
and type hints to determine which provider to load and how to play a given source. The following
is a table of supported media file extensions and types for each provider:

| Media     | Extensions                                                               | Types                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Audio** | m4a, m4b, mp4a, mpga, mp2, mp2a, mp3, m2a, m3a, wav, weba, aac, oga, spx | audio/mpeg, audio/ogg, audio/3gp, audio/mp4, audio/webm, audio/flac, audio/object                                                         |
| **Video** | mp4, ogg, ogv, webm, mov, m4v                                            | video/mp4, video/webm, video/3gp, video/ogg, video/avi, video/mpeg                                                                        |
| **HLS**   | m3u8                                                                     | application/vnd.apple.mpegurl, audio/mpegurl, audio/x-mpegurl, application/x-mpegurl, video/x-mpegurl, video/mpegurl, application/mpegurl |

:::yes
The following are valid as they have a file extension (e.g, `video.mp4`) or type
hint (e.g., `video/mp4`):
:::

- `src="https://example.com/video.mp4"`
- `src="https://example.com/hls.m3u8"`
- `src = { src: "https://example.com/video", type: "video/mp4"  }`
- `src = { src: "https://example.com/hls", type: "application/x-mpegurl"  }`

:::no
The following are invalid as they are missing a file extension and type hint:
:::

- `src="https://example.com/video"`
- `src="https://example.com/hls"`

### Source Sizes

We do not currently support providing multiple static source sizes such as
`[{ src: "...", size: 480 }, { src: "...", size: 720 }, ...]`. We will most likely add support
for this feature but only for the initial load similar to the `<picture>` element. The sources will
not show up in the video quality API. Please use an adaptive streaming protocol such as HLS as
explained in the [Video Qualities](#video-qualities) section below.

### Supported Codecs

Vidstack Player relies on the native browser runtime to handle media playback, hence it's
important you review what containers and codecs are supported by them. This also applies to
libraries like [`hls.js`][hlsjs] which we use for HLS playback in browsers that don't support
it natively.

While there are a vast number of media container formats, the ones listed below are the ones
you are most likely to encounter. Some support only audio while others support both audio and
video. The most commonly used containers for media on the web are probably MPEG-4 (MP4), Web Media
File (WEBM), and MPEG Audio Layer III (MP3).

**It's important that both the media container and codecs are supported by the native runtime.**
Please review the following links for what's supported and where:

- [Media Containers][media-containers]
- [Audio Codecs][audio-codecs]
- [Video Codecs][video-codecs]

[hlsjs]: https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js
[media-containers]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers
[audio-codecs]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs
[video-codecs]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs

## Providers

Providers are auto-selected during the [source selection][source-selection] process and
dynamically loaded via a provider loader (e.g., `VideoProviderLoader`). The following providers
are supported at this time:

- [Audio][audio-provider]
- [Video][video-provider]
- [HLS][hls-provider]
- Dash: coming soon.
- YouTube: coming soon.
- Vimeo: coming soon.

:::info
See [source types](#source-types) for how to ensure the correct media provider is loaded.

[hls-provider]: /docs/wc/player/api/providers/hls

### Provider Events

The following events will fire as providers change or setup:

::code[./provider-events]

### Provider Types

The following utilities can be useful for narrowing the type of a media provider:

::code[./provider-types]

## Audio Tracks

Audio tracks are loaded from your HLS playlist. You can not manually add audio tracks to the
player at this time. See the [Audio Tracks API][audio-tracks-api] guide for how to interact
with audio track programmatically.

[audio-tracks-api]: /docs/player/api/audio-tracks

## Text Tracks

Text tracks allow you to provide text-based information or content associated with video
or audio. These text tracks can be used to enhance the accessibility and user experience of
media content in various ways. You can provide multiple text tracks dynamically like so:

::code[./text-tracks]

:::info
See the [Text Tracks API][text-tracks-api] guide for how to interact with text tracks programmatically.
:::

[text-tracks-api]: /docs/player/api/text-tracks

### Text Track Default

When `default` is set on a text track it will set the mode of that track to showing immediately. In
other words, this track is immediately active. Only one default is allowed
per [track kind](#text-track-kinds).

::code[./text-track-default]

### Text Track Formats

The [vidstack/media-captions][media-captions] library handles loading, parsing, and rendering
captions inside of the player. The following caption formats are supported:

- [VTT][captions-vtt]
- [SRT][captions-srt]
- [SSA/ASS][captions-ssa]
- [JSON](#json-tracks)

See the links provided for more information and any limitations. Do note, all caption formats
are mapped to VTT which is extended to support custom styles. In addition, browsers or
providers may also support loading additional text tracks. For example, Safari and the HLS provider
will load captions embedded in HLS playlists.

You can specify the desired text track format like so:

::code[./text-track-type]

[media-captions]: https://github.com/vidstack/media-captions
[captions-vtt]: https://github.com/vidstack/media-captions#vtt
[captions-srt]: https://github.com/vidstack/media-captions#srt
[captions-ssa]: https://github.com/vidstack/media-captions#ssaass

### Text Track Kinds

The following text track kinds are supported:

- `subtitles`: Provides a written version of the audio for non-native speakers.
- `captions`: Includes dialog and descriptions of important audio elements, like music
  or sound effects.
- `chapters`: Contains information (e.g, title and start times) about the different
  chapters or sections of the media file.
- `descriptions`: Provides information about the visual content to assist individuals who are
  blind or visually impaired.
- `metadata`: Additional information or descriptive data within a media file. This metadata can
  be used for various purposes, like providing descriptions, comments, or annotations related to the
  media content. It is not displayed as subtitles or captions but serves as background information
  that can be used for various purposes, including search engine optimization, accessibility enhancements,
  or supplementary details for the audience.

::code[./text-track-kind]

### JSON Tracks

Text tracks also support the `json` type. The resource at the given src should return a
JSON object with:

- An optional `regions` array of partial [`VTTRegion`][vtt-region] objects
- An optional `cues` array of partial [`VTTCue`][vtt-cue] objects.

::code[./json-captions]

The type can be specified on the text track like so:

::code[./text-track-json]

Example JSON file with cues:

::code[./json-cues]{title=cues.json}

Example JSON file with regions:

::code[./json-regions]{title=regions.json}

[vtt-region]: https://github.com/vidstack/media-captions/blob/main/src/vtt/vtt-region.ts
[vtt-cue]: https://github.com/vidstack/media-captions/blob/main/src/vtt/vtt-cue.ts

### LibASS

We provide a direct integration for a [WASM port of libass][jassub] if you'd like to use advanced
ASS features that are [not supported][captions-ssa].

1. `npm i jassub`

2. Copy the `node_modules/jassub/dist` directory to your public directory (e.g, `public/jassub`)

3. Add the `LibASSTextRenderer` to the player like so:

::code[./libass]{copy=true}

:::info
See the [JASSUB options][jassub-options] for how to further configure the LibASS renderer.

## Video Qualities

Adaptive streaming protocols like [HLS][hls-wiki] not only enable streaming media in chunks, but
also have the ability adapt playback quality based on the device size, network conditions, and
other information. Adaptive qualities is important for speeding up initial delivery and to
avoid loading excessive amounts of data which cause painful buffering delays.

Video streaming platforms such as [Cloudflare Stream][cf-stream] and [Mux][mux] will take an input
video file (e.g., awesome-video.mp4) and create multiple renditions out of the box for you,
with multiple resolutions (width/height) and bit rates:

<img
  src={hlsManifestImage.src}
  alt="HLS manifest with multiple child resolution manifests."
  decoding="async"
  loading="lazy"
  style="aspect-ratio: 2 / 1"
/>

By default, the best quality is automatically selected by the streaming engine such as [hls.js][hlsjs].
You'll usually see this as an "Auto" option in the player quality menu. It can also be manually set
if the engine is not making optimal decisions, as they're generally more conservative to avoid
excessive bandwidth usage.

Once you have your HLS playlist by either creating it yourself using [FFMPEG][ffmpeg] or using
a streaming provider, you can pass it to the player like so:

::code[./play-hls]

:::info
See the [Video Qualities API][video-quality-api] guide for how to interact with renditions
programmatically.
