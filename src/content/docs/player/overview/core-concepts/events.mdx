## Media Events

You can find a complete list of media events fired in the **[Player API Reference][player-api]**. The
player smoothes out any unexpected behavior across browsers, attaches additional metadata to the
event detail, and rich information such as the request event that triggered it or the origin event
that kicked it off.

::code[./media-events]

## Media Request Events

Vidstack Player is built upon a [request and response model][player-architecture] for updating
media state. Requests are dispatched as events to the player component. The player attempts
to satisfy requests by performing operations on the provider based on the given request, and
then attaching it to the corresponding media event.

For example, the `media-play-request` event is a request to begin/resume playback, and as a
consequence it'll trigger a `play()` call on the provider. The provider will respond with a
`play` or `play-fail` event to confirm the request was satisfied. You can find a complete list
of media request events fired in the [Player API Reference][player-api].

::code[./request-events]

**When are request events fired?**

Media request events are fired by Vidstack components generally in response to user actions. Most
actions are a direct consequence to UI events such as pressing a button or dragging a slider.
However, some actions may be indirect such as scrolling the player out of view, switching
browser tabs, or the device going to sleep.

**How are request events fired?**

Request events are standard DOM events which can be dispatched like any other, however, they're
generally dispatched by using the [`MediaRemoteControl`][remote-control] as it's simpler. A
good practice is to always attach [event triggers](#event-triggers) to ensure requests can be
traced back to their origin. This is the same way all Vidstack components dispatch requests
internally.

## Event Triggers

All events in the library keep a history of **trigger events** which are stored as a chain. Each
event points to the event that came before it all the way up to the **origin event**. The following
is an example of a chain that is created when the play button is clicked and media begins playing:

<img
  src={eventChainImage.src}
  alt="Media playing event chain diagram"
  decoding="async"
  loading="lazy"
/>

chains.

## Event Types

All event types are named using _PascalCase_ and suffixed with the word _Event_
(e.g., `SliderDragStartEvent`). Furthermore, media events are all prefixed with the word _Media_ as
seen in the examples below. Refer to each component's docs page to see what events are fired.
