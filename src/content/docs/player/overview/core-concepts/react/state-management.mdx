description: A guide on how to read, update, and subscribe to media state.

## Reading

The `useMediaState` and `useMediaStore` hooks enable you to subscribe directly to specific
media state changes, rather than listening to potentially multiple DOM events and binding it
yourself.

Tracking media state via events is error prone and tedious:

::code[./bad-state-tracking]

:::yes
Tracking media state via hooks:
:::

::code[./good-state-tracking]

You can omit the ref if you're calling the hooks inside a player child component as the
media context is available:

::code[./good-state-tracking-child]

You can find a complete list of all media states available in the [Player State Reference][player-state].

### Avoiding Renders

The `useMediaState` and `useMediaStore` hook will trigger re-renders. For some media state this
may be too expensive or unnecessary. You can subscribe to state updates directly on the player
instance to avoid triggering renders:

::code[./avoid-renders]

When inside a player child component you can get a player instance reference with
`useMediaPlayer`:

::code[./avoid-renders-child]

## Updating

The `useMediaRemote` hook creates and returns a [`MediaRemoteControl`][remote-control] object. The returned
class provides a simple facade for dispatching [media request events][request-events].
This can be used to request media playback to play/pause, change the current volume level, seek
to a different time position, and other actions that change media state.

::code[./media-remote]

The example above shows that event triggers can be provided to all methods on the
[`MediaRemoteControl`][remote-control] class. Trigger events enable connecting media events back to
their origin event. This can be useful when trying to understand how a media event was triggered,
or when analyzing data such as the time difference between the request and when it was performed.
