description: A guide on how to read, update, and subscribe to media state.

## Reading

You can retrieve a snapshot of the current media state like so:

::code[./player-state]

## Subscribing

The player has a media store that keeps track of the running media state. The
store enables you to subscribe directly to specific media state changes, rather than listening
to potentially multiple DOM events and binding it yourself.

:::no
Tracking media state via events is error prone and tedious:
:::

::code[./bad-state-tracking]

:::yes
Tracking media state via store subscription:
:::

::code[./good-state-tracking]

## Updating

Media state updates can be requested directly on the player element. Do note the difference between
props and methods:

::code[./update-player]

:::info
All player properties and methods can be found in the [Player API reference][player-api].

### Remote Control

The [`MediaRemoteControl`][remote-control] class provides a simple facade for dispatching
[media request events][request-events]. This can be used to request media playback to
play/pause, change the current volume level, seek to a different time position, and
other actions that change media state.

::code[./remote-control]

The example above shows that event triggers can be provided to all methods on the `MediaRemoteControl`
class. Trigger events enable connecting media events back to their origin event. This can be
useful when trying to understand how a media event was triggered, or when analyzing data such as
the time difference between the request and when it was performed.

:::info
See the [`MediaRemoteControl`][remote-control] API docs for all available methods.
