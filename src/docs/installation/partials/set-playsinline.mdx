The `playsinline` property will indicate that video content should be played inline **(on mobile only)**,
rather than launching the video in fullscreen mode on play. In addition, setting this property
will also ensure custom player UI is displayed on iPhone when playing
inline (hidden in fullscreen mode as native controls are forcefully displayed by the browser).

Important to note, we normalize the playing inline behaviour across all mobile browsers. If you
do not set `playsinline`, the video will launch in fullscreen on play in all mobile browsers, not
just iOS Safari where the attribute is accepted.
