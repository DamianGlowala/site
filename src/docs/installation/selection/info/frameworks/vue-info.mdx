We don't have a specific integration for [Vue][vue] at the moment. However, you can enjoy all
Vidstack Player features through our [Web Component][wc] library as [Vue has perfect support][vue-ce].

We also ship JSX types to make sure you have complete TypeScript support for props and events! In
addition, we don't use Shadow DOM so it will work with SSR-frameworks like Nuxt.
