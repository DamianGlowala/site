We don't have a specific integration for [Solid][solid] at the moment. However, you
can enjoy all Vidstack Player features through our [Web Component][wc] library as
[Solid has perfect support][solid-ce].

We also ship JSX types to make sure you have complete TypeScript support for props and events! In
addition, we don't use Shadow DOM so it will work with SSR-frameworks like SolidStart.
