Using the [JSDelivr CDN][jsdelivr] is the simplest and fastest way to start using the player
library via [Web Components][wc].

We provide a CDN bundle that includes all package dependencies, and it's specially minified to get
the bundle size as small as possible. Add a few `<script>` and `<style>` tags to your `<head>` element
and you're ready to start building!
