The [Tailwind][tw] option provides you with a minimal starting point and completely unstyled
components. All components including the player itself provide styling hooks via
data attributes and support animations.

Our [optional plugin][docs-tw] can help speed you up even more by providing you with easy to
use media variants such as `media-paused:opacity-0`.
